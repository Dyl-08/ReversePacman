Click the spacebar to start the game. Navigate the circle through the maze to the finish line. The goal is to avoid the maze boundaries - hitting the boundary results in a lost life. The user has 5 lives to spare before the game is considered over. The yellow dots are integrated into the maze to help the user shrink the circle, lowering the chance that it hits the boundary. The user must also avoid the moving obstacles. If the circle hits the obstacle, the circle's size will magnify - further increasing the chance the circle hits the boundary and the user loses a life.
